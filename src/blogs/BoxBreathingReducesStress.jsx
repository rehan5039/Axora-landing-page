    <p class="lead">Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a simple yet powerful technique that can help you regain composure and reduce stress in just minutes.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Box Breathing?</h2>
    <p>Box breathing is a breathing technique that follows a simple pattern: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, and hold again for 4 counts. This creates a "box" or square pattern of equal duration for each part of the breath.</p>
    <p>This technique is used by Navy SEALs during high-stress situations and has been adopted by athletes, executives, and healthcare professionals to manage stress and improve focus.</p>
    
    <h2>The Science Behind Box Breathing</h2>
    <p>When we're stressed, our breathing becomes shallow and rapid, triggering our sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight response). Box breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest response) by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream, which helps calm the nervous system</li>
      <li>Slowing heart rate and reducing blood pressure</li>
      <li>Increasing focus and mindful awareness</li>
      <li>Reducing stress hormone production</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Practice Box Breathing</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to practice box breathing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Inhale</strong> slowly through your nose for a count of 4</li>
      <li><strong>Hold</strong> your breath for a count of 4</li>
      <li><strong>Exhale</strong> slowly through your mouth for a count of 4</li>
      <li><strong>Hold</strong> your breath again for a count of 4</li>
      <li>Repeat this cycle 4-5 times, or for 2-3 minutes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For beginners, you can start with a count of 3 if 4 feels too challenging, and gradually work your way up.</p>
    
    <h2>When to Use Box Breathing</h2>
    <p>Box breathing can be particularly helpful in these situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before important meetings or presentations</li>
      <li>During moments of acute stress or anxiety</li>
      <li>To help fall asleep at night</li>
      <li>When feeling overwhelmed or emotionally reactive</li>
      <li>As part of a daily meditation practice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Box breathing is a simple, portable stress-management tool that requires no special equipment and can be practiced anywhere. By incorporating this technique into your daily routine, you can improve your stress resilience, enhance focus, and promote overall wellbeing.</p>
