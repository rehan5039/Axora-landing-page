    <p class="lead">Starting a meditation practice can be challenging. Here are 5 tips to help you begin your journey to mindfulness and inner peace.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Start Small</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is trying to meditate for too long. Start with just 3-5 minutes a day and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.</p>
    <p>Consistency is more important than duration. It's better to meditate for 5 minutes every day than 30 minutes once a week.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Find a Comfortable Position</h2>
    <p>You don't need to sit in a perfect lotus position to meditate effectively. The most important thing is to find a position that's comfortable for you, whether that's sitting on a chair, cushion, or even lying down.</p>
    <p>Just make sure your spine is straight to prevent drowsiness, and your body is relaxed but alert.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Focus on Your Breath</h2>
    <p>The breath is a powerful anchor for meditation. Simply paying attention to the sensation of breathing – the rise and fall of your chest, the air moving through your nostrils – can help calm your mind.</p>
    <p>When your mind wanders (and it will), gently bring your attention back to your breath without judgment.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Use Guided Meditations</h2>
    <p>As a beginner, guided meditations can be incredibly helpful. Having a voice to guide you through the process takes the pressure off wondering if you're "doing it right."</p>
    <p>The Axora app offers a variety of guided meditations specifically designed for beginners.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Be Patient and Kind to Yourself</h2>
    <p>Meditation is a skill that takes time to develop. Don't get discouraged if your mind wanders constantly or if you don't feel immediate benefits.</p>
    <p>Remember that every time you notice your mind has wandered and you bring it back to your focus, you're strengthening your mindfulness muscle.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Meditation is a journey, not a destination. By starting small, finding a comfortable position, focusing on your breath, using guided meditations, and being patient with yourself, you'll be well on your way to establishing a fulfilling meditation practice.</p>
